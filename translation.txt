 The benefits of going green are not obvious to everyone in the 
organization especially to CEO. These people in t he organization are

terms of monetary benefits. For example, if  one is explaining the 
efficiency using following lines, attention of CEO will get lost at the data 
center.  
  "Changing data center from old rack server to new consolidated blade 
serve r (responsible for handling tasks of multiple server using 
virtualization  technology) will be more efficient."  
 Rather, explaining the above lines in following way will attract the CEO's 
ear. 
 "Changing old rack servers into new consolidated blade servers will save 
approximately Rs. 40000 in electrical costs per server per year and by 
the way data center has 5000 server".
